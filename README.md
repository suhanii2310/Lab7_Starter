1. I would fit my automatd tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed.
This is beacause it would ensure that whenever any new code is pushed it gets tested automatically. This will help catch errors and bugs early on and bad code wont be on the main branch.

2. No, e2e should be used to test user interaction and not individual functions.

3. Navigation mode tests how a website loads and performs when someone first visits the page. It checks how fast and smooth the page loads. Snapshot mode just takes a picture of the current page to check how it looks.

4. The three things are:
    -Add a <meta name="viewport"> tag to improve mobile display.
    -Resize images or use next-gen formats like WebP to reduce load time.
    -Add a <meta name="description"> tag to improve SEO and search visibility.
